It was necessary to obtain information from news feeds and identify three positions for the report:
1. Top-5 mentioned news in the news feeds with the links to the primary source piece of news; 
2. List of unique news for every news feed with links to news;
3. Quantity of news in every news feed.

Information about the sources is stored in the config.json file. To obtain information from news sources was used a library - feedparser.
To store the information we need on news feeds and articles were used classes Feed and Article.
After parsing the feed, instances of class Feed are formed with all necessary further information. Thus formed a list of objects - feeds.
Further, to identify which news is repeated, in another source I used the built-in library difflib to compare strings for similarity (various algorithms have been tested,
but increase in speed was negligible).
Also, for convenience, I built an adjacency matrix by articles, in the cells of which I wrote the similarity coefficient.
Based on the matrix, I formed clusters of similar news and filtered them by publication date to find the primary source. 
Along the way, I added a flag is_unique=True to the news which did not fall into clusters of similar news.
